# Consistent hashing
Traditional hashing uses a modulo function to map keys to nodes, this works well for a fixed number of nodes, but adding or removing nodes requires data migration. Consistent hashing maps keys to a range of hash values and uses a hash ring to map keys to nodes, which allows nodes to be added or removed with minimal data migration. This makes consistent hashing more efficient and scalable in distributed systems.
